It can monitor the start and stop events of Docker containers in real-time, automatically configure Nginx reverse proxy for each Docker container without manual intervention, greatly simplifying the Nginx configuration process in the container environment.
```
# 第一步启动 nginx-proxy
docker run --detach \
    --name nginx-proxy \
    --publish 80:80 \
    --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro \
    nginxproxy/nginx-proxy:1.6

# 第二步启动应用
docker run --detach \
    --name your-proxied-app \
    --env VIRTUAL_HOST=hellogithub.com \
    nginx
```

39、[VoxelSpace](https://hellogithub.com/en/periodical/statistics/click?target=https://github.com/s-macke/VoxelSpace)：Terrain Rendering Algorithm in Less Than 20 Lines. This is an algorithm for terrain rendering, with the core code consisting of less than 20 lines. It recreates the rendering technique used in the classic game Comanche (Voxel Space), providing developers with an example for learning and reference.
```python
def Render(p, height, horizon, scale_height, distance, screen_width, screen_height):
    # Draw from back to the front (high z coordinate to low z coordinate)
    for z in range(distance, 1, -1):
        # Find line on map. This calculation corresponds to a field of view of 90°
        pleft  = Point(-z + p.x, -z + p.y)
        pright = Point( z + p.x, -z + p.y)
        # segment the line
        dx = (pright.x - pleft.x) / screen_width
        # Raster line and draw a vertical line for each segment
        for i in range(0, screen_width):
            height_on_screen = (height - heightmap[pleft.x, pleft.y]) / z * scale_height. + horizon
            DrawVerticalLine(i, height_on_screen, screen_height, colormap[pleft.x, pleft.y])
            pleft.x += dx

# Call the render function with the camera parameters:
# position, height, horizon line position,
# scaling factor for the height, the largest distance, 
# screen width and the screen height parameter
Render( Point(0, 0), 50, 120, 120, 300, 800, 600 )
```
