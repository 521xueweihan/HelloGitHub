41、[ENGAGE](https://hellogithub.com/en/periodical/statistics/click?target=https://github.com/TUDSSL/ENGAGE)：Self-made Battery-less GameBoy. This project achieves a GameBoy that operates without batteries, powered solely by solar energy and game play. It is capable of running Tetris and can save the game's progress when the power runs out, meaning that upon restarting the game, the falling block will be in the same position. Doesn't that sound cool? Everything needed to make this device is included, so interested students can give it a try.
